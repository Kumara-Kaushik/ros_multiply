# ros_multiply
A simple set of nodes to multiply two integers.

## Instructions:
- run `catkin build` from within the catkin_ws folder
- sourve `devel/setup.bash`
- run the launch file using command `roslaunch multiply product.launch`
- enter two integers as prompted

The log should show the input integers along with the output.

P.S: Didnt focus on edge cases etc, this was mainly to focus on building nodes, custom msgs and writing a launch script.
